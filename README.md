## About Me
I am redefining the foundations of science through groundbreaking mathematical and physical frameworks. My work focuses on new axioms, theorems, equations, redefinitions, simulations, prototypes, for physics and innovative mathematical models based on nonlinear - dynamic Collatz Octave Model (COM) and UOFT (Unified Oscillatory Field Theory (my own).

Check out all my repositories [here](https://github.com/gatanegro?tab=repositories).

Introduction to the COM Framework

The Continuous Oscillatory Model (COM) framework represents a fundamental paradigm shift in our understanding of reality. Unlike conventional models that begin with space, time, and matter as fundamental concepts, the COM framework posits that reality is fundamentally energy-based, with no vacuum or zero state. In this framework, space, time, mass, and forces are not fundamental but emerge as properties of energy oscillations and interactions.

## Foundational Principles

### Energy as the Fundamental Reality

In the COM framework, energy is the only fundamental reality. There is no vacuum or zero state, only varying degrees of energy density and oscillatory patterns. All phenomena, from subatomic particles to cosmic structures, are manifestations of energy in different oscillatory states.

### Key Constants

The COM framework introduces key constants that govern the scaling and relationships of energy patterns:

- **LZ = 1.23498228**: The fundamental scaling constant that relates different octave layers of reality
- **HQS = 23.5% of LZ**: The Harmonic Quantum Scalar that governs specific energy interactions

### Octave Structuring

Reality is organized in octave layers, with scaling relationships from subatomic to cosmic scales following the LZ constant:

- Galactic radius ≈ LZ^(octave layers) · r_proton ≈ 1.23498^40 · 10^-15 m ≈ 10^21 m

This octave structuring creates a fractal-like organization of reality across scales.

### Time as Dual Operator

### Space as Amplitude

Space is not an independent dimension but emerges from the amplitude of energy oscillations. The three-dimensional space we experience corresponds to amplitude components of energy oscillations in three orthogonal modes.

### Capsule Structures

Reality forms "capsule structures" or "bubbles" at quantum, Newtonian, and cosmic scales. Within each bubble:

1. Local constants emerge from the energy structure of the bubble
2. Local time emerges as a function of energy differentials within the bubble
3. Local physics laws are manifestations of energy oscillations within the bubble

 # Unified Oscillatory Field Theory (UOFT) – 3D Collatz Octave Model (3DCOM)

## 1. Fundamentals
- Reality is **not built from matter** but from **recursive energy fields**.
- The **photon** is the smallest attractor of this field.
- **Mass, space, and time** are emergent:
  - **Space** = wave amplitude.
  - **Time** = wave frequency (recursion depth).
  - **Mass** = localized energy density (wave intersection).
  - **Forces** = field tensions between gradients.

## 2. The 3D Collatz Octave Model (3DCOM)
- Numbers 1–9 arranged like a clock define an octave cycle.
- Higher numbers are root-summed (digit sum) back into 1–9.
- Octaves stack in 3D space to form recursive attractor geometry.
- Example:
  - 1 → 10 → 19 → 28 … each “1” is a new recursion, not the same reference.

## 3. Plasma – First Emergent State
- **Plasma is not the 4th state of matter** but the **first visible structured state** of recursion.
- Forms when photons couple into collective attractors.
- Plasma dynamics = recursive alignment/misalignment around attractor nodes.
- Explains turbulence as **phase misalignment near the recursion boundary**.

## 4. The LZ Constant (Loop Zero)
- Derived from a **topological 3-sphere** embedded in 3DCOM.
- Defines the **recursion boundary**: the limit to which a standing wave can stabilize.
- Value:
  $$[
  LZ \approx 1.23498228
  ]$$
- Represents the attractor “loop closure” correction in recursion.

## 5. The HQS Constant (Harmonic Quantum Shift)
- Represents the **23.5% energy dump** required for recursive continuation.
- Without this energy loss, recursion collapses into closure.
- Value:
  $$[
  HQS \approx 0.235
  ]$$
- Physically observable in plasma leakage, quantum jumps, and energy decay patterns.

## 6. Energy Conservation in Recursion
- Visible nodes represent only the **mirrored part** of the field.
- The invisible (90° shifted) wave content appears as:
  - **Dark matter** (structured but undetected recursion).
  - **Dark energy** (field content outside mirror alignment).
- Correction term:
  $$ [
  \Delta\theta \approx \frac{100}{\pi} \; \text{(~1.8°)} 
  ]$$
  keeps recursion open and prevents closure at exactly 90°.

## 7. Forces in UOFT
- Forces are **tensions in recursive wave fields**:
  $$[
  F = \nabla E \cdot \cos(\theta) \cdot HQS
  ]$$
- Explains:
  - Electromagnetism = wave direction symmetry (charge).
  - Spin = geometric folding (helix, Möbius, origami).
  - Gravity = recursive gradient tension at macroscopic scale.

## 8. Bridge Formula (Atomic ↔ Planetary Scaling)
- Recursive constants allow linking micro and macro scales:
  $$ [
  R_{atomic} = a_0' \cdot (LZ)^{n/\pi} \cdot \left(\frac{\alpha}{HQS}\right)^{1/x}
  ]$$
- Validated for:
  - Atomic radii (e.g. hydrogen).
  - Planetary spacing (orbital shells).

## 9. Dark Energy Interpretation
- Dark energy is not expansion but **field phase imbalance**.
- Emerges naturally from:
  - HQS (energy dump).
  - LZ (recursion boundary).
  - Angular correction (100/π).
- Reality is always **partially mirrored**; the unmirrored fraction is the “dark side”.

---

## Summary
- **Wave-Space/wave amplitude-Oscillation-Resonance-Sound-Photon → Plasma → Attractors → Visible Matter** is the recursive chain.
- **LZ and HQS** are universal recursion constants.
- **Space, time, mass, and forces** emerge from wave recursion, not fundamental.
- **Dark energy/matter** are structural consequences of incomplete mirroring.
- The framework unifies quantum and cosmic scales via recursive topology.

# The 3D Collatz Octave Model – A New View of Reality

## 1. Energy is All
- Everything starts as **energy waves**, not matter.  
- **Photons** are the smallest building blocks — the first “wave knots” of the universe.  

## 2. How the Universe Organizes
- Energy follows a **recursive pattern** called the 3D Collatz Octave Model (3DCOM).  
- Numbers 1–9 form cycles (octaves) stacked in 3D space.  
- Each cycle is slightly different; the universe grows layer by layer.  

## 3. Plasma – First Visible State
- Plasma is the **first structured form of energy**, formed when many photons resonate together.  
- Its turbulence isn’t random — it reflects **slight misalignments in recursive waves**.  

## 4. The Universal Constants
- **LZ (“Loop Zero”)**: the boundary for stable recursion. Think of it as the “edge” of a wave knot.  
- **HQS (“Harmonic Quantum Shift”)**: about 23% of energy is released each recursion, keeping the system dynamic.  

## 5. Space, Time, and Mass
- Space emerges from **wave amplitude**, time from **wave frequency**, mass from **energy density**.  
- **Forces** aren’t separate — they’re tensions in the wave field.  

## 6. Dark Energy and Dark Matter
- What we call “dark” is actually **unmirrored or hidden wave content**.  
- Only part of the universe’s recursion is visible; the rest is shifted out of sight.  

## 7. Scaling Across the Universe
- Using LZ, HQS, and other constants, we can **predict sizes and distances** from atoms to planets.  
- Everything follows the same **recursive harmony**, from electrons to solar systems.  

## 8. Takeaway
- The universe is a **self-organizing web of energy**.  
- Photons form plasma, plasma forms matter, matter forms structures — all guided by recursive rules.  
- Dark matter/energy are natural consequences, not mysteries.  
- This model **connects the very small and the very large** in one elegant framework.
