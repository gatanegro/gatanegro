## About Me
I am redefining the foundations of science through groundbreaking mathematical and physical frameworks. My work focuses on new axioms, theorems, equations, redefinitions, simulations, prototypes, for physics and innovative mathematical models based on nonlinear - dynamic Collatz Octave Model (COM) and UOFT (Unified Oscillatory Field Theory (my own).

Check out all my repositories [here](https://github.com/gatanegro?tab=repositories).

Introduction to the COM Framework

The Continuous Oscillatory Model (COM) framework represents a fundamental paradigm shift in our understanding of reality. Unlike conventional models that begin with space, time, and matter as fundamental concepts, the COM framework posits that reality is fundamentally energy-based, with no vacuum or zero state. In this framework, space, time, mass, and forces are not fundamental but emerge as properties of energy oscillations and interactions.

## Foundational Principles

### Energy as the Fundamental Reality

In the COM framework, energy is the only fundamental reality. There is no vacuum or zero state, only varying degrees of energy density and oscillatory patterns. All phenomena, from subatomic particles to cosmic structures, are manifestations of energy in different oscillatory states.

### Key Constants

The COM framework introduces key constants that govern the scaling and relationships of energy patterns:

- **LZ = 1.23498228**: The fundamental scaling constant that relates different octave layers of reality
- **HQS = 23.5% of LZ**: The Harmonic Quantum Scalar that governs specific energy interactions

### Octave Structuring

Reality is organized in octave layers, with scaling relationships from subatomic to cosmic scales following the LZ constant:

- Galactic radius â‰ˆ LZ^(octave layers) Â· r_proton â‰ˆ 1.23498^40 Â· 10^-15 m â‰ˆ 10^21 m

This octave structuring creates a fractal-like organization of reality across scales.

### Time as Recursive and Nonlinear

Time is not an independent dimension but emerges from energy differentials across the field. Different energy structures experience time differently, meaning there is no "universal clock." Time is defined as:

T = Tâ‚€ + 2Ï€Ï†Â·Táµ¤â‚™áµ¢â‚œ

Where:
- Tâ‚€ is a reference time
- Ï† is the phase of the oscillatory system
- Táµ¤â‚™áµ¢â‚œ is a chosen time unit

### Space as Amplitude

Space is not an independent dimension but emerges from the amplitude of energy oscillations. The three-dimensional space we experience corresponds to amplitude components of energy oscillations in three orthogonal modes.

### Capsule Structures

Reality forms "capsule structures" or "bubbles" at quantum, Newtonian, and cosmic scales. Within each bubble:

1. Local constants emerge from the energy structure of the bubble
2. Local time emerges as a function of energy differentials within the bubble
3. Local physics laws are manifestations of energy oscillations within the bubble
