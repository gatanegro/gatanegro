A Unified Oscillatory Field Theory
Abstract:
This summary introduces a novel framework positing the universe as a fundamental oscillatory field.
In this model, matter emerges as localized oscillatory nodes (soliton-like structures), forces arise
from synchronization and phase gradients, and spacetime is interpreted as an emergent property of
global phase relationships. The theory is governed by a nonlinear wave equation, and numerical
simulations reveal energy stabilization corresponding to the mass gap-the minimum energy required
to form localized wave structures. This approach unifies quantum mechanics, relativity, and field
interactions while addressing phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy.
Key Equations:
1. Governing Wave Equation:
/t - c + g - = 0
2. Energy Density:
E = (/t) + c() + g -
Numerical Simulations:
Numerical simulations of the nonlinear wave equation were conducted using finite difference
methods on a computational grid. Gaussian initial conditions were applied to model localized wave
packets. The simulations demonstrated energy stabilization at a threshold corresponding to the
mass gap:
Mass Gap (m_gap) = E_gap / c
Stabilized energy results highlight the soliton's minimum energy requirement, aligning withtheoretical predictions.
Predictions and Implications:
1. Gravitational Waves:
Phase distortions in the oscillatory field propagate as gravitational waves, providing a new
perspective on gravitational waveforms.
2. Dark Matter and Energy:
Unobservable oscillatory modes contribute to gravitational effects (dark matter) and global phase
tension (dark energy).
3. Particle Collisions:
Predictions for soliton-like resonances in high-energy particle collisions can be tested
experimentally.
Conclusion:
This framework unifies spacetime, matter, and forces under the paradigm of an oscillatory field. It
provides insights into unresolved phenomena and offers testable predictions for gravitational waves,
dark matter, and particle physics. Future research will extend these results to higher-dimensional
simulations and experimental validation.
